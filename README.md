# Picture-in-Picture (PiP)

Picture-in-picture (PiP) is a feature that allows users to view multiple video sources simultaneously on a single screen. It enhances the viewing experience by enabling users to keep an eye on additional content without having to switch between different applications or inputs.

The implementation of PiP typically involves overlaying a smaller video window on top of the primary content, which remains visible in the background. Users can resize, move, or toggle the PiP window according to their preferences.
